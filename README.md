# Game of Bots

Game of Bots is a web based multiplayer game. There is a better description with screenshots coming soon :)

## Docker

A Dockerfile is provided to make it easy to run this game using Docker Compose. Simply run the following command:

```
docker-compose up
```

When debugging you may want to run docker-compose as a daemon like so:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

The `--build` flag is useful to rebuild the containers from scratch.

You are then able to check the logs using any of the following commands

```
# all logs
docker-compose logs
# tail all logs
docker-compose logs -f
```

When you want to stop the containers run the following:

```
docker-compose down
```

## Local development

```
npm install 
```

Run the server using `npm run start` from the root directory.

While developing it is recommended to use `npm run dev` as this allows for automatic updates to the running server without having to restart the server, it will automatically do that whenever you save changes to a file.

The game will run at `http://localhost:8080`

## Branch naming convention

Branches use the `GOB` prefix followed by a dash and the ticket #. So a branch for ticket 1 would be `GOB-1`.
